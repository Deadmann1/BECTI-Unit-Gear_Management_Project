# BECTI-Unit-Gear_Management_Project
This is my standalone gear manager for the popular mission by Benny, in the videogame Armed Assault 3.

You can generate a gear and untis file, which you can replace in your mission file to add or remove, modded or vanilla items, units and vehicles.

It currently uses a MySql Server, but support for other databases will be coming soon.
