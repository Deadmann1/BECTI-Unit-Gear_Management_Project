# BECTI-Unit-Gear_Management_Project
This is my standalone gear manager for the gamemode BECTI (Benny Capture the Island) by Benny, in the videogame Armed Assault 3.

You can load the gear and untis files, which you can then modfiy/backup/replace etc.

Compatibility:
All missions based on Benny's BECTI should work, if they are using the same structure of files for gear/units/vehicles.

All used licensed parts belong to their respective authors.
